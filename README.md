**Central repository of Data Structures & Algorithms implementations and LeetCode problem solutions in multiple languages.**

---

## ⚙️ About This Repository

This repo contains a curated collection of algorithms and coding challenge solutions implemented with clean, well-documented code in:

| Language   | Status |
|------------|--------|
| C++        | ✅     |
| Java       | ✅     |
| Python     | ✅     |
| Kotlin     | ✅     |

### Target Topics:
- **Leetcode problems** codes for many leetcode problems majorly asked in interviews.
- **Data Structures And Algorithms** codes for implementation for data structures and algorithms along their time complexities.

---

## 🔍 Why This Repo?

- 🧩 **Multi-language** implementations — learn polymorphism and translate logic between languages
- 🔄 Real-world scenario: many coding interviews evaluate candidates in different stacks
- 💡 Clear, reusable code with comments and examples for beginners to advanced devs

---

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Discover** problem by browsing language/category folders  
2. **Open** the respective `.cpp`, `.java`, `.py`, or `.kt` file  
3. **Compile/run** according to language requirements:
   - C++: `g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp && ./a.out`
   - Java: `javac File.java && java File`
   - Python: `python3 file.py`
   - Kotlin: `kotlinc file.kt -include-runtime -d file.jar && kotlin file.jar`
